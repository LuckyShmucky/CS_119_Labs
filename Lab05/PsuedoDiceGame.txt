# process - determine what was rolled and who won 

display what the player and the computer rolled

#count the dice rolls in order to find any pairs, 3 of a kind and so on
if any side of a die is rolled add it to an object as a prop and set it's value equal to one
if it is rolled again add one to that same key's value

# now find the highest roll combination

loop through the counts
    if the current count is greater than the previous highest roll, than this is the new maximum (cMax or pMax)



# output display the type of roll, who won the round

if pMax > cMax then
    display player wins
else if cMax > pMax then 
    display computer wins
esle 
    display tie
